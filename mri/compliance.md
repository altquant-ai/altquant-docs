# Compliance, Usage & Disclaimers

This document covers how the AltQuant Market Risk Intelligence datasets should be used, what they're designed for, and what limitations apply.

## What This Data Is For

The Market Risk Intelligence datasets provide market regime detection and risk condition data for institutional research and monitoring. They're built to support portfolio teams who need systematic awareness of changing market conditions.

Appropriate uses include:

- Understanding current market regime context
- Monitoring risk conditions across volatility, breadth, and macro dimensions
- Supporting portfolio research and backtesting workflows
- Adding explainability to risk reports and investment committee materials
- Integrating regime awareness into existing quantitative processes

These datasets are not designed for direct trade execution, automated order generation, or retail investment guidance.

## No Investment Advice

Nothing in this data constitutes investment advice. The regime classifications, risk labels, and derived fields represent our analytical interpretation of market conditions. They are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any security.

Users are responsible for their own investment decisions. If you're using this data to inform portfolio positioning, you should combine it with your own analysis and consult with qualified professionals as appropriate.

## About the Labels and Classifications

The datasets include categorical fields with names like BUY_ZONE, MOMENTUM_OK, CAUTION, HIGH_RISK, RISK_ON, RISK_OFF, and similar labels. Fields like recommended_action and positioning_bias also appear in certain views.

These names are chosen for clarity and consistency across institutional workflows. They describe market conditions as we measure them. They are not literal trading instructions. A field called BUY_ZONE indicates our assessment that conditions are favorable for risk-taking, not that you should buy anything in particular.

Treat these as contextual indicators that inform your own process, not as signals to act on directly.

## AI-Generated Content

Some views include narrative summaries generated by language models based on the underlying quantitative signals. This content is deterministic in its inputs but may vary slightly in phrasing.

These narratives exist for decision support and explainability. They help translate numeric signals into readable context for reports and discussions. They should not be used for automated execution without independent validation against the source data.

## Signal Behavior and Limitations

A few things to understand about how these signals work:

The data operates on a daily cadence and is designed for multi-day institutional horizons. Signals are stateful and tend to evolve gradually rather than flip abruptly. This is intentional—we prioritize stability over sensitivity.

Historical patterns do not guarantee future outcomes. The signals reflect conditions as measured by our methodology, which was developed and validated across multiple market regimes. Extreme or unprecedented events may produce signal behavior that differs from historical norms.

Data availability may be affected by market holidays, shortened trading sessions, or delays in underlying inputs. Some macroeconomic and cross-asset data sources have inherent lags that propagate through to derived signals.

This data works best as one input among several in a broader analytical framework. It is not a standalone decision engine.

## Data Quality Considerations

Users should monitor data completeness as part of their integration. Where we provide coverage or quality metadata, review it as part of production workflows.

We maintain internal monitoring and validation processes, but downstream users are responsible for confirming that data meets their requirements before acting on it.

## Intellectual Property

The methodology behind these datasets—how signals are constructed, how thresholds are calibrated, how factors are selected and combined, how regime transitions are determined—is proprietary.

Our documentation describes what the data contains and what it means. It does not disclose implementation details, calibration specifics, or the logic underlying signal generation. This is intentional and reflects standard practice for proprietary analytical products.

## Licensing and Redistribution

Use of these datasets is governed by your subscription agreement. Unless we've agreed otherwise in writing:

- You may not redistribute, resell, or sublicense the data
- You may not publish derived datasets that replicate our methodology
- Internal use within your organization is permitted per the terms of your license

If you have questions about what's permitted under your agreement, reach out.
